## 📌 Project Overview

- Developed a classification model using **XGBoost** and historical retail data
- Tools: Python, scikit-learn, Pandas
- Evaluated model performance using **AUC (Area Under the Curve)** score
- Analyzed key features like sales volume, population, and area metrics

---

## 💡 Key Highlights

- Achieved an AUC score of **0.76**
- Conducted exploratory data analysis to identify patterns in store performance
- Applied feature importance techniques to understand business drivers
- Built an end-to-end machine learning pipeline
